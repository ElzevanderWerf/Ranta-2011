for all x1 , x1 is of the same size as a , b is medium and for all x1 , x1 is a student

a is small or for all x1 , b is even

for all x1 , for all x1 , x1 is even and at least one of these holds : \item a is a tetrahedron and b is a prime \item for all x1 , x1 is large

there is an element x1 such that if x1 is a cube , then a is to the right of itself and for all x1 , there is an element x1 such that x1 is to the right of b

it is not the case that if a is a student or a is larger than itself , then b is not medium

there is an element x1 such that if x1 is to the left of a or a is adjacent to x1 , then if a is of the same shape as x1 , then a is a student

there is an element x1 such that if x1 is medium , then x1 is small or x1 is in front of itself

there is an element x1 such that there is an element x1 such that x1 is larger than a

it is not the case that for all x1 , a is a tetrahedron or x1 is in back of a

it is not the case that there is an element x1 such that for all x2 , a is a pet

it is not the case that all these hold : \item a is a student \item a is a tetrahedron or b is a pet

all these hold : \item for all x1 , x1 is even , a is a dodecahedron or b is a cube \item there is an element x2 such that if x2 is a tetrahedron , then x2 is adjacent to itself

there is an element x1 such that if there is an element x1 such that x1 is in the same column as itself , then if x1 is small , then x1 is a dodecahedron

for all x1 , if x1 is not medium , then x1 is not large
