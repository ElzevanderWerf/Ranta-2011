for all x1 , a is large or a is a tetrahedron and it is not the case that for all x2 , a is the same shape as x3

there is an element x1 such that x1 is larger than a

if if a is even or b is a dodecahedron , then there is an element x1 such that x2 is the same size as x3 , then there is an element x3 such that if x1 is medium , then c is even

all these hold : \item if x1 is in front of x2 or x3 is even , then there is an element x3 such that a is small , there is an element x1 such that x3 is large \item a is not small

if all these hold : \item x1 is a cube \item a is large or b is left of x2 , then there is an element x1 such that x1 is in the same row as itself or x2 is small

it is not the case that if a is a pet , then there is an element x1 such that x2 is adjacent to itself
