With difficult here I mean the following: very long formulas, formulas with a lot of x/y variables that are hard to translate to something more concrete as we would normally phrase it, such as 'all cubes'. - I also think that the 'if' statements were harder to translate to a more fluent sentence, for the translation system. - I found the translations also less fluent and less clear if the existential quantifiers were translated to "for some/all elements x/y", instead of "all tetrahedrons".  - when formulas were 'strange', i.e., when there was a quantifier for x/y while the rest of the formula did not contain the same x/y anymore
