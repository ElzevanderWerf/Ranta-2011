As in the translation: there is a cube such that a is a person or x is adjacent to a. Weakness: it gets confusing when the formula is bigger and there are multiple implications. As in the translation: for all x , if it is not the case that there is an element y such that if x is a dodecahedron , then y is to the right of x , then there is an element z such that x is to the right of z
