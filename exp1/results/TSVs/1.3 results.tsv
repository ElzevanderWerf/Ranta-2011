3/12/2022 4:01:24	I confirm this	Female	24	3	Yes	4	3		Yes	5	5		Yes	3	2	there does not exist a z such that z is not a cube and not large	Yes	4	3	e is either in front of d or a tetrahedron, large and not in front of d	Yes	3	4		Yes	3	4	for all x and y it holds that either x is not a cube, y is not in front of x or x is small.	Yes	4	2	for all x, if x is a dodec and there is no z to the right of x, then there is a w to the left of x	Yes	3	2	there does not exist a w such that for all y, if w and y are a tet, they are in the same column.	No	2	2	It is always the case that, if x is a dodec, then if all y's are cubes and right of x, then x is large	Yes	5	5		Yes	3	2	NO	Yes	4	4		Yes	3	3	there exists an x such that all x are not a prime.	Yes	4	3		Yes	4	2	either a is even or there is an x that is a tetrahedron and a y that is larger than itself.	Yes	5	5		No	4	3	at least one of these holds: if a is even, there there must be an x that is even. Or, if there exists an even x or if b is a cube then b is right of itself	Yes	5	5		Yes	2	1	there is an x such that all y's are not in the same column as a	Yes	5	5		No	3	2	there is no element x such that if a has the same shape as b, c is in its same row.	No	3	4	for all x, it is the case that either x is a tet, a is a prime, or there is an x such that if x is a person, a is a student.	No	4	3	there exist an x such that for all y, x is larger than a and for all y, b is not a pet	No	4	3	there exists an element x such that if x is a tet and has the same shape as a, then x and a are adjacent	No	4	4	there is a cube x such that if a is a person, x is adjacent to a	I think the system has difficulties with reading ( and ), it sometimes mixes up which sub part belongs to which side of the operators. The system performs sufficiently well for non-combined logic formulas. For example, starting with one E or A and limited or/and connections. The systems appears to me as if it is able to structurally read the logic formulas which is a nice thing.	No.
