I was suprised how some sentences were really nicely written, but faulty! I guess that sometimes it reads the 'implies' as an 'and' in longer sentences. but most of the sentences were correct	Eventhough I read the final question beforehand, I find it a difficult question (I already spend 46 minutes so far oops)
