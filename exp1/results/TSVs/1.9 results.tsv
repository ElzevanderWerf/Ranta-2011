I think for smaller formulas the system works pretty good. However, for larger formulas the translations become quite long and messy sentences where they instead could be more concise (e.g. "for all x , for all y" instead of "for all x and y"). Also, the commas where not aligned with the word before it, which is a small thing but very important for readability when there are so much of them. And in English the word "a" is often used, so when translating the variable "a" (or all variables maybe to be more consistent) it should be diffirentiated somehow (by itallics, bold, or another font maybe). And this would also help with readability.	Overall the system works pretty good. And with some small fixes and some more context sensitive alterations to make the sentences flow better, it could become a really reliable translation system.
