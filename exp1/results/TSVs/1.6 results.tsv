Yes	4	1	e is neither in the same column as d, nor in the same column as c	Yes	4	2	Every cube that is in front of something is small.	Yes	5	1	Every cube is right of a and left of b	No	3	3	If neither b nor d is a tetrahedon, then at least one of d and b is left of the other.	Yes	4	2	for every cube x and tetrahedon y, y is to the right of x.	Yes	5	5		Yes	5	2	There does not exist a medium cube.	Yes	4	3		Yes	5	2	Everything is either not a pet or the same size as a while a is in front of itself, or both.	Yes	4	2	There is an element x such that everything is a pet, and a is behind x	No	2	2	There is a situation in which a is a cube, or a is in front of everything, or both	Yes	5	2		No	3	2	If there is an even student, every x is either in the same column of itself, or a is a pet, or both.	Yes	4	2	There is a situation in which a is not prime or there exists something that is not a tetrahedron, or both	Yes	5	3	I'd change the first point to "everything is a pet and there is a situation in which a is small"	Yes	4	1	There exists something that is not prime	Yes	2	1	a being left of b implies that b is a dodecahedron	Yes	2	1		No	3	2	There is no situation in which the fact that a and b are the same shape implies that c is in the same row as itself.	No	4	3		No	2	2	there is an x larger than a and b is never a pet.	No	4	3	There is an element x for which the fact that x is a tetrahedon of the same shape as a implies that it is adjacent to a.  Or  There is an element x that is either adjacent to a or not a tetrahedon of the same shape as a, or both. 	No	4	3	Doesn't look like a valid formula	The system sometimes doesn't simplify the expression enough (like double negation or repeated clauses), which makes it difficult to read in natural language. Also, it is often the case that the "or" operator is translated as "a or b" while the natural language "or" often implies the "exlusive or", making it ambiguous. It sometimes handily describes it in terms of "at least one of the following hold", which is definitely better in my opinion. The system deals well with implications and more simple expressions. 	The discrepancy between the logical "or" and the natural language "or" might be really hard - if not impossible - to overcome in written language, since the difference is mostly accentuated by intonation (so only in spoken language). In Dutch and English, the logical "or" can sometimes be made clear by discarding the article of the second element of the clause (e.g. "Zullen we een biertje of wijntje doen?", "Shall I take a book or magazine with me?"), but this is still situational. However, the "exclusive or" can be written as "óf ... óf ..." and "either ... or ..."
