Though I may be wrong I'm not too fluent in first order logic	I think, fluency wise, it's not very good at the AND operator thing. It usually just says something like "These things hold : * one thing *the other thing". That's not really something a normal person would say right? also when multiple All/Some thingies start a sentence it just stacks the "for all, for some, for all, for some, it hold that: for all etc". I get that it's hard to make it sound human but all the commas really make it less clear.  All in all the system is usually quite clear but it rarely sounds like an English sentence unless it's very simple.	That took quite a while :^). Don't know if it's possible to put a progress tracker somewhere in google docs but it would be quite nice to know how much longer I have to translate logic. Good luck with your thesis!
