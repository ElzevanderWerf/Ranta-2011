If c is not a cube, then e is a cube.	Yes		4	2	If x is a dodecahedron and not to the left of y, x is small.	No	This translation needs an extra parenthesis after Tet (y)	4	4		Yes		4	4		Yes		5	5		Yes		5	5		Yes		5	5		Yes		5	5		Yes		4	3	at least one of these holds : item x1 is a prime and x1 is medium or item x2 is not a dodecahedron and for all x1, a is not small.	Yes		4	5		Yes		4	4		No	If' does not belong to the translation	4	5	x1 is of the same shape as x2 of x2 is to the left of a or if all x1 is small, then there is an element x2 such that for all x3, x1 is a pet.	Yes		5	5		Yes		4	5	I think 'item' should be deleted --> if for all x1, a is a person, then for all x2, x3 is in back of a and there is an element x2 such that there is an element x3 such that b is to the right of c.	Yes		5	5		Yes		4	5		Yes		5	5		Yes		5	5		Yes		5	5		No	There is no 'person' in the translation	5	4	for all x1 , x1 is a tetrahedron or x2 is a prime or there is an element x1, such that if x1 is a person then x2 is a student.	Yes		5	4	There is an element x1 such that for all x2, x1 is larger than a and x3 is not a pet.	No	not 'all x1', and Tet(x1) is forgotten.	4	4	There is an element x1, such that if x1 is of the same shape as a and x1 is a Tetra, then x1 is adjacent to a.	No	The if...then misses in the translation	5	5	There is a cube such that if a is a person, x1 is adjacent to a.	The more simple formulas give a clear translation. The more complex the formulas are, the more difficult it is to understand the English translation. It does not give a very logical English sentence.
