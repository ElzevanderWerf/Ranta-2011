form.setDescription("Thank you very much for participating in this experiment. It will take approximately 15 to 30 minutes to fill in this survey. If at any point you would like to stop, you can close this form and your response will be deleted. If you do wish to participate, your response will be handled anonymously: The information in this study will only be used in ways that will not reveal who you are. You will not be identified in any publication from this study or in any data files shared with other researchers. Your participation in this study is confidential. \n\nThe purpose of this experiment is to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of a system that translates first-order logic formulas into English. We will present to you, one by one, 25 formulas with their translations, such as the one below:\n\n\tFormula:\t\t\t\tÂ¬ â x ( Cube ( x ) â§ LeftOf ( b , x ) )\n\tEnglish translation:\t\tIt is not the case that b is to the left of some cube\n\nPlease answer the following questions for each of them:\n\t1. Is the translation ğ°ğ¼ğ¿ğ¿ğ²ğ°ğ, yes or no? By a correct translation, we mean that the sentence conveys the same information as the input logical formula (there is no possible world in which the formula is true while the English translation is false, or vice versa).\n\t2. Is the translation ğ°ğ¹ğ²ğ®ğ¿? By a clear translation, we mean that the sentence is understandable and does not have multiple readings.\n\t3. Is the translation ğ³ğ¹ğğ²ğ»ğ? By a fluent translation, we mean that the sentence sounds like a natural English sentence.\n\t4. Do you have a suggestion for a ğ¯ğ²ğğğ²ğ¿ ğğ¿ğ®ğ»ğğ¹ğ®ğğ¶ğ¼ğ»? Think, for example, about how the translation can be improved given the above three criteria (correctness, clarity, and fluency). However, you can be very free in your ideas here, write whatever you like! \n\nğ¬ğ¼ğğ¿ ğ®ğ»ğğğ²ğ¿ ğğ¼ ğ¾ğğ²ğğğ¶ğ¼ğ» ğ° ğ¶ğ ğºğ¼ğğ ğ¶ğºğ½ğ¼ğ¿ğğ®ğ»ğ ğ³ğ¼ğ¿ ğğ. Especially if you think the given translation is unclear and/or not fluent, write down a translation that you think is more understandable and/or sounds better. A translation should always be one or more whole sentences.\n\nIn answering all questions, please note that it is very important that you evaluate the quality of the translations and base your opinion only on the semantic content (the meaning) of the formula, not on its specific syntactic form (such as the order of the conjuncts). In other words, think about whether the translation is suitable given the formula\'s meaning, no matter what the formula looks like.\n\nThe survey will start off with a few personal questions and a practice example. After you have answered all of the questions for each formula and translation pair, you will be asked to give a general structured review of the strengths and weaknesses of the translation system. With which types of sentences does the system have difficulties? For which types of sentences do you believe the system performs sufficiently well? Please keep this final question in mind while evaluating the translations.\n\nFor your information, these are the interpretations of the predicates used:\nDodec ( x )\t\t\t\tx is a dodecahedron\nSmall ( x )\t\t\t\tx is small\nStudent ( x )\t\t\t\tx is a student\nMedium ( x )\t\t\t\tx is medium\nCube ( x )\t\t\t\tx is a cube\nPrime ( x )\t\t\t\tx is a prime\nPerson ( x )\t\t\t\tx is a person\nTet ( x )\t\t\t\t\tx is a tetrahedron\nPet ( x )\t\t\t\t\tx is a pet\nLarge ( x )\t\t\t\tx is large\nEven ( x )\t\t\t\tx is even\nAdjoins ( x , y )\t\t\tx is adjacent to y\nSameCol ( x , y )\t\t\tx is in the same column as y\nLeftOf ( x , y )\t\t\tx is to the left of y\nRightOf ( x , y )\t\t\tx is to the right of y\nSmaller ( x , y )\t\t\tx is smaller than y\nFrontOf ( x , y )\t\t\tx is in front of y\nLarger ( x , y )\t\t\tx is larger than y\nSameRow ( x , y )\t\tx is in the same row as y\nSameShape ( x , y )\t\tx is the same shape as y\nSameSize ( x , y )\t\t\tx is the same size as y\nBackOf ( x , y )\t\t\tx is in back of y\n");
