Give a general structured review of the strengths and weaknesses of the translation system. With which types of sentences does the system have difficulties? For which types of sentences do you believe the system performs sufficiently well?	Do you have any final comments?

Yes		4	2	tetrahedrons and cubes are never the same size	Yes		4	2	some cube is larger than some tetrahedron	Yes		3	1	every cube has a tetrahedron right of it in the same row.	Yes		3	2	nothing is a cube with something in the back of it, or small	Yes		4	3	c and d are not in front of b, and they are not in front of c	Yes		3	2	nothing is both right of b and a cube at the same time	Yes		4	3	if c is medium, then f, e, and d are not cubes	Yes		4	3	Every cube is neither in the same column as a nor in the same column as b	Yes		3	2	If d and b have the same shape, then they have the same size.	Yes		2	3	Everything that has no element in the back is a cube.	Yes		4	2	There are no large cubes.	Yes		2	2	there is no element x such that x is larger than all elements that are left of b                                and x is left of a	Yes		4	2	If everything is in front of any cube, then that cube is small.	Yes		3	2	if a dodecahedron has a cube right of it, then it is large	Yes		3	2	if some cube is smaller than a, then y is smaller than every tetrahedron	Yes		5	3	Something is a large cube and left of b	Yes		3	2	all small cubes are in back of something	Yes		4	3	a is larger than c but not large, and e is larger than c but not large	Yes		3	2	there is an element y such that y is large , y is a cube and there is an element x such that y is in front of x , x is small and x is a cube  There is a small cube that has a large cube in front of it.	Yes		3	2	x1 is not a person and not medium, and x3 is medium	Yes		1	1		Yes		4	2	a is adjacent to itself	Yes		5	4		Yes		4	5		Yes		3	4	None of these hold: - a is an even cube - x1 is in the same row as itself - x1 is medium	Yes		2	2	it is not the case that if x2 is right of x3, then x2 is smaller than a and x1 is large	Yes		4	3		Yes		4	3		Yes		2	2	a is a pet or b is the same size as a or x2 is the same shape as c	Yes		5	5		Yes		3	2	a is in the same row as everything else, or x3 is not left of b	Yes		5	5		Yes		1	2	It is not the case that both x1 is in the same column as a and b is cube. Furthermore, c is a cube.	Yes		5	5		Yes		3	2	x1 is not medium or x2 is not a cube or a is medium	Yes		3	3		Yes		3	1	If all elements are even, then a is tetrahedron.	Yes		3	1	a is small or x2 is not even	Yes		3	2	Both of these hold:  - a is larger than x1  - if x2 is large, then x3 is a prime	Yes		4	2		No	conjunction instead of implication	3	2	If x2 is not in the same row as itself, then a is not in the same shape as b.	No	missing information (a is a pet)	3	2	There is an element bigger than x2 and a is a tetrahedron	No	Missing information	3	2	Everything is a tetrahedron or x2 is a prime or x2 is a student	No	the scope of x1 does not go over the second part of the formula (after &)	3	2	Something is larger than a and x3 is not a pet	Bad: vacuous quantification. Good: short formulas
